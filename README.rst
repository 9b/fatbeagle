Fat Beagle
==========
Fat Beagle is a Chrome Extension that collects URLs being accessed while the user browses the Internet. It specifically looks for scripts, domains and asynchronous requests. Once those items are collected, they are saved within local storage and later sent in bulk to the RiskIQ landing page crawler service. 

Why
---
Browsing websites produces hundreds of URLs, many of which may be new to the RiskIQ crawlers. Collecting these URLs gives RiskIQ an advantage on potentially seeing new hosts or content that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. 

Configuration
-------------
Users can configure Fat Beagle with a URL, token and private key for the RiskIQ API.
